This presentation will explain the MVC in a beginner friendly manner and uses a Harry Potter analogy to help make it more fun and clear.

Now lets talk about each component.

It is needed as a way to organize the interactions between the user, server and database so that system processes can be completed in an organized and streamlined manner. Benefits include code reusability, allows test driven development and full control over HTML and URLs. Overall, it also allows code at a bigger scale to be worked on by multiple developers without breaking or blocking one anotherâ€™s work.

Here is story time. 
We are in the world of Harry Potter.

![12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKDEVE/MVC-presentation/master/mvc12.png)

Let say we have an user called Voldemort. What he wants is to track down Harry Potter (as always). 

![13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKDEVE/MVC-presentation/master/mvc13.png)

Therefore, he makes his requests to his workers beneath him. He talks to Router Lucius, who is a loyal worker.

![14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKDEVE/MVC-presentation/master/mvc14.png)

His job is to run to a room called the Controller room, filled with many workers who all go by the title Controller.

![15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKDEVE/MVC-presentation/master/mvc15.png)

Each Controller specializes in understanding exactly what the user writes on his notes (especially since the user Voldemort has terrible penmanship and grammar). Any info that the user needs always comes through the Controllers.

Once the Castle Controller has figured out exactly what the king wants, he goes into the next part of the castle called the Model Room.

 The Controller can't give the boring scribbled scroll to User Voldemort, otherwise his life is at risk.

That's all! Hope it helps! Thank you!
